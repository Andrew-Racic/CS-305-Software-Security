# CS-305-Software-Security
Portfolio Submission From my CS-305 Software Security class


1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
   
•	Client Overview: Artemis Financial is a financial services company that deals with sensitive financial data and transactions. Their operations require robust security measures to protect client information and maintain regulatory compliance.
•	Software Requirements: They needed a thorough security evaluation of their software systems. Specifically, they required a vulnerability assessment to identify and mitigate potential security risks within their applications.
•	Issue to Address: The company was concerned about possible vulnerabilities in their software that could be exploited by malicious actors. They wanted to ensure that their software was secure against threats such as data breaches, unauthorized access, and other cyberattacks.

2. What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
•	Successes in Finding Vulnerabilities:
o	Comprehensive Assessment: I conducted a detailed analysis of the software, using both automated tools and manual code reviews to uncover hidden vulnerabilities.
o	Detailed Reporting: I provided clear and actionable reports that outlined each vulnerability, its potential impact, and recommended remediation steps.
o	Effective Communication: I collaborated with the development team to ensure they understood the vulnerabilities and the importance of addressing them promptly.
•	Importance of Secure Coding:
o	Data Protection: Secure coding practices prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive data from being compromised.
o	Regulatory Compliance: Helps the company comply with financial industry regulations, avoiding legal penalties.
o	Reputation Management: Maintains client trust and the company's reputation by preventing security breaches.
•	Value to the Company:
o	Risk Mitigation: Reduces the likelihood of costly security incidents.
o	Operational Continuity: Ensures systems run smoothly without interruptions due to security issues.
o	Competitive Advantage: Demonstrates a commitment to security, which can be a selling point to clients.

3. Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
•	Challenging Aspects:
o	Complex Vulnerabilities: Dealing with sophisticated security flaws that required deep technical knowledge to understand and address.
o	Technology Stack Familiarity: Learning and assessing technologies or frameworks that were new to me.
o	Prioritization: Determining which vulnerabilities needed immediate attention versus those that were less critical.
•	Helpful Aspects:
o	Learning Experience: Gained valuable insights into common security pitfalls and how to avoid them.
o	Enhanced Skills: Improved my analytical and problem-solving skills by tackling real-world security issues.
o	Collaboration: Working with others may have provided new perspectives and shared knowledge.

4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
•	Increasing Security Layers:
o	Input Validation: Implemented strict input validation to prevent injection attacks.
o	Authentication and Authorization: Strengthened user authentication mechanisms and ensured proper authorization checks.
o	Encryption: Used encryption for sensitive data both at rest and in transit.
o	Security Frameworks: Leveraged established security frameworks or libraries that offer built-in protection.
•	Future Assessment Tools and Techniques:
o	Automated Scanning Tools: Utilize tools like OWASP ZAP, Nessus, or Burp Suite for regular vulnerability scanning.
o	Security Standards Compliance: Align with standards such as OWASP Top Ten or NIST guidelines to identify and mitigate risks.
o	Risk Assessment Models: Use models to evaluate the potential impact and likelihood of vulnerabilities to prioritize mitigation efforts.

5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
•	Ensuring Functionality and Security:
o	Testing: Performed thorough unit, integration, and regression testing to ensure that changes didn't break existing functionality.
o	Code Reviews: Conducted peer reviews to catch potential issues and validate code quality.
o	Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Integrated automated tests into the CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early.
•	Checking for New Vulnerabilities:
o	Re-Assessment: Ran vulnerability scans and security tests after refactoring.
o	Static Code Analysis: Used static analysis tools to detect any new security flaws introduced during code changes.
o	Monitoring and Logging: Implemented monitoring to detect unusual activities that might indicate security issues.

6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
•	Resources and Tools:
o	Static Analysis Tools: Tools like SonarQube or FindBugs for detecting code issues.
o	Security Frameworks: Utilizing frameworks that promote security by default (e.g., Spring Security for Java applications).
o	Educational Resources: Websites like OWASP and resources on secure coding practices to stay informed.
•	Coding Practices:
o	Secure Coding Standards: Adhering to standards like CERT Secure Coding.
o	Documentation: Maintaining clear documentation for code and security protocols.
o	Least Privilege Principle: Ensuring that code and applications run with the minimum level of privileges necessary.

7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
•	Potential Portfolio Inclusions:
o	Vulnerability Assessment Report: A sanitized version showcasing your my to identify and communicate security issues effectively.
o	Code Samples: Examples of refactored code that demonstrate secure coding practices (ensuring no proprietary or sensitive information is included).
o	Project Documentation: Outlining the process I followed, tools used, and the impact of my work on improving software security.
